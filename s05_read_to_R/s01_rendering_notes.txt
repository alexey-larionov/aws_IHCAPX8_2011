# Rendering RMD outside of R-Studio
# AL10Apr2021

# This could be useful for rendering a very long RMD scripts
# in screen instead of interactive rendering in R-Studio
# to avoid the risk of interruption because of a broken connection.

# Screen refresher
#-----------------

# - screen -ls
# - screen -S vep
# - ./s07_annotate_with_vep.sh &> s07_annotate_with_vep.log
# - ctr-a d
# - screen -r vep
# - exit

# In the screen
#--------------

# To make sure that the R-environment is the same as in R-Studio switch to r-user
su - r-user # aws-2021

# Just rendering with the command like this
# Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('test.Rmd')"
# may fail if there is no pandoc in the path

# The simplest way is to use the pandoc from the R-Studio installation
# by adding it to the path, as advised here:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35077224/paths-in-ssh-versus-rstudio-server-for-pandoc-and-knitr

PATH=/usr/lib/rstudio-server/bin/pandoc/:$PATH
cd /test/script/folder
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('test.Rmd')"
# R -e "library('rmarkdown'); render('test.Rmd')"

# An alternative approach could be to install pandoc system-wide

sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel
sudo yum -y install pandoc --enablerepo=epel
